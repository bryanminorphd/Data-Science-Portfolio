In this project, I look at the birth rate(X-axis) and life expectancy(Y-axis) statistics by country through scatterplots. The scatterplots are categorised by countries regions (Europe, America, Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Oceania). I have data for the years 1960 and 2013. Scatterplots have been produced for both years and a comparison is drawn.
