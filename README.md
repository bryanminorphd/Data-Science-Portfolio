In this project, I explore the birth rate(X-axis) and life expectancy(Y-axis) statistics by country through scatterplots. The scatterplots are categorised by countries regions (Europe, America, Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Oceania). Scatterplots have been produced for the years 1960 and 2013 and then a comparison is drawn.
