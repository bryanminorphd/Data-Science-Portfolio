# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains projects that are completed by myself for self-learning, and hobby purposes. The projects are written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R markdown. Click on the project titles to access the codes and writeups.

Please feel free to reach out either by email or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismail-frz/), if you are interested in learning more about my skills, experience, and academic background.

## Projects

- ### Python
  -  **[Predicting Loan Payback:](https://github.com/ismail-frz/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20Loan%20Payback.ipynb)**
  Investors are often interested in learning the risks involved in lending money. This project attempts to predict the people (borrowers) who have high probability of paying back their loans.
  
  -  **[Customer Segmentation:](https://github.com/ismail-frz/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine_Learning:%20Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)** 
  This project involves analyzing KPIs and segmenting customers using GMM and K-Means clustering algorithms. The dataset used here is available on Kaggle.
  
  -  **[Stock Market Analysis:](https://github.com/ismail-frz/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Stock%20Market%20Analysis.ipynb)** 
  I will explore the stock market data for some tech giants in this project. I am particularly interested in Microsoft's stock.
  
  -  **[World Trends in Fertility and Life expectancy:](https://github.com/ismail-hm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/World%20Trends%20in%20Birth%20rate%20and%20Life%20Expectancy.ipynb)** 
     In this project, I explore fertility and life expectancy statistics by country through scatterplots. The scatterplots are categorised by countries regions.


- ### R
  - **[Exploratory Movie Data Analysis:](http://rpubs.com/ismail-hm/555820)**
     This project is focused on exploratory analysis of the Movies_Dataset by cleaning the dataset, and then exploring relationships between identified variables.
