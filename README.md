# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains projects that are completed by me for self-learning and hobby purposes. These projects are written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R markdown. Click on the project titles to access the codes and writeups.

## Projects

### Python

- #### [World Trends in Birth rate and Life expectancy](https://github.com/ismail-hm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/World%20Trends%20in%20Birth%20rate%20and%20Life%20Expectancy.ipynb)

In this project, I explored the birth rate(X-axis) and the life expectancy(Y-axis) statistics by country through scatterplots. The scatterplots are categorised by countries regions (Europe, America, Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Oceania). Scatterplots have been produced for the years 1960 and 2013 and then a comparison is drawn.
