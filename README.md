# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains projects that are completed by myself for hobby purposes. The projects are written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R markdown. Click on the project titles to access the codes and writeups.

Please feel free to contact me either by email or [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismail-frz/), if you are interested in learning more about my skills, experience, and academic background.

## Projects

- ### Python
  -  **[Machine Learning_Customer Segmentation:](https://github.com/ismail-frz/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine_Learning:%20Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)** 
  This project involves analyzing KPIs and segmenting customers using GMM and K-Means clustering algorithms. The dataset used here is available on Kaggle.
  
  -  **[World Trends in Birth rate and Life expectancy:](https://github.com/ismail-hm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/World%20Trends%20in%20Birth%20rate%20and%20Life%20Expectancy.ipynb)** 
     In this project, I explored the birth rate(X-axis) and the life expectancy(Y-axis) statistics by country through scatterplots. The scatterplots are categorised by countries regions (Europe, America, Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Oceania). Scatterplots have been produced for the years 1960 and 2013 and then a comparison is drawn.


- ### R
  - **[Movie Data Analysis:](http://rpubs.com/ismail-hm/555820)**
     This project is focused on exploratory analysis of the Movies_Dataset by cleaning the dataset, and then exploring relationships between identified variables.
